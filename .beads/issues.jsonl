This transforms the right pane from file-only to a flexible context pane supporting files, git graph, diffs, and commit details.","design":"## Architecture\n\n### 1. Extend Right Pane Content Type\n\nChange `rightFile: string | null` to:\n```typescript\ntype RightPaneContent = \n  | { type: 'file'; path: string }\n  | { type: 'git-graph' }\n  | { type: 'diff'; base: string; head: string; file?: string }\n  | { type: 'commit'; hash: string };\n```\n\nUpdate `useSplitView.ts` and `PageStateContext.tsx` accordingly.\n\n### 2. TabzChrome Backend Endpoints\n\nAdd to TabzChrome backend:\n```\nGET /api/git/log?path=\u003crepo\u003e\u0026limit=50\u0026offset=0\nGET /api/git/diff?path=\u003crepo\u003e\u0026base=\u003csha\u003e\u0026head=\u003csha\u003e\nGET /api/git/show?path=\u003crepo\u003e\u0026commit=\u003csha\u003e\nGET /api/git/branches?path=\u003crepo\u003e\n```\n\n### 3. Git Graph Layout Algorithm\n\nPort from Maestro's approach:\n1. Fetch commits via `git log --all --topo-order --format=\"%H|%h|%s|%an|%ae|%aI|%P|%D\"`\n2. Process newest→oldest, assign rails (columns)\n3. Track active columns for branch lines\n4. Connection types: straight, mergeLeft/Right (Bezier), offScreen\n5. 8 colors assigned by column index mod 8\n\n### 4. Components\n\n```\nsrc/components/git/\n├── GitGraph.tsx          # Main container\n├── GitGraphCanvas.tsx    # Canvas layer for rails/lines\n├── GitGraphRow.tsx       # Commit node + metadata\n├── CommitDetailPanel.tsx # Expanded commit view\n├── DiffViewer.tsx        # Side-by-side or unified diff\n└── graphLayout.ts        # Layout algorithm\n```\n\n### 5. Rendering Strategy\n\n- **Canvas layer** (background): Draw rails and Bezier curves\n- **DOM layer** (foreground): Commit nodes and text for accessibility\n- **Virtual scrolling**: Load 50 commits at a time, infinite scroll\n\n### 6. Node Styles\n\n- Normal: filled circle\n- Merge commit: hollow center\n- HEAD: double ring\n- Selected: thick border\n- Colors: 8-color palette based on rail index\n\n### 7. Interactions\n\n- Click commit → show commit details in panel\n- Click file in commit → switch right pane to diff view\n- Double-click file → open in left pane\n- Toolbar buttons: checkout, revert, cherry-pick (spawn terminal)\n\n### 8. Integration Points\n\n- Toolbar: Add git graph toggle button\n- Sidebar context menu: \"Show in Git Graph\"\n- SourceControl page: Link to detailed graph view","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Git log endpoint returns paginated commits with parent refs\n- [ ] Layout algorithm correctly assigns rails to branches\n- [ ] Canvas renders branch lines with Bezier curves for merges\n- [ ] Commits display in virtual scrolling list\n- [ ] Click commit shows diff/details\n- [ ] Works with current workspace repo\n- [ ] Infinite scroll loads more commits\n- [ ] HEAD and current branch highlighted","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"marcinek.matthew@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T09:35:56.305277151-05:00","created_by":"GGPrompts","updated_at":"2026-02-04T10:05:33.774662823-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T10:05:33.774662823-05:00","close_reason":"Completed","labels":["git","ui","v2"]}
